# My Vote is Worth a Vote

## üß† Purpose

This proposal presents a structured simulation framework to evaluate the safety, fairness, and validator incentives under Solana‚Äôs proposed Alpenglow consensus protocol. It builds on Chorus One‚Äôs analysis and integrates real-world validator data available from the Trillium API.

## üéØ Goals

- Validate consensus safety under latency, failure, and stake imbalance scenarios.
- Evaluate MEV centralization and economic fairness in fast vs. slow finality paths.
- Identify geographic and relay-related disadvantages for global validator distribution.
- Provide reproducible simulation input using open, real-time data.

## üîó Data Source

Live validator performance metrics are sourced from:
[https://api.trillium.so/recency_weighted_average_validator_rewards](https://api.trillium.so/recency_weighted_average_validator_rewards)

## üß© Input Data Schema (Key Fields)

| Field | Description | Simulation Role |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| `identity_pubkey` | Validator ID | Node uniqueness |
| `average_stake_percentage` | Stake weight | Voting power |
| `average_skip_rate` | Slot reliability | Liveness simulation |
| `average_mev_to_validator` | MEV earnings | Reward modeling |
| `average_median_vote_latency` | Vote arrival timing | Fork race modeling |
| `average_votes_cast` | Vote activity | Finality quorum input |
| `asn`, `country`, `region` | Network geography | Latency simulation |

## üß± Simulation Architecture

This proposal is language-agnostic. Suggested modules:

- `ValidatorSet`: Ingest and normalize JSON data
- `RelayNetwork`: Assign latency/failure risks
- `ConsensusRound`: Simulate fast vs. slow finality
- `RewardEngine`: Calculate rewards, MEV share, penalties

## üß™ Test Plan

| Concern | Scenario | Metric |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Fork resolution timing | Two async leaders | Finality winner latency |
| Safety margin under fault | 25% skip rate | Certificate failure rate |
| Reward centralization | Latency-favored validator | MEV over 10 epochs |
| Regional relay inequality | Non-relay validator | Block inclusion failure %

## ü§ù Chorus One Alignment

This simulation framework directly addresses these Chorus One concerns:

- ‚úÖ Weak adversarial threshold (20%)
- ‚úÖ Economic centralization under low-latency
- ‚úÖ Relay bias (Rotor)
- ‚úÖ Lack of PoH reorder/catch-up
- ‚úÖ Lack of public testbed

## üì¢ Call to Action

We invite AG contributors, Anza, and community validators to collaborate on this effort and provide feedback or sponsorship to formally test consensus readiness before deployment of Alpenglow.
