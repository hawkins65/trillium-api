-- This script calculates and inserts slot duration statistics for each validator
-- for a specific epoch. It joins the leader schedule with slot duration data,
-- filters for produced blocks with valid durations, and then calculates
-- min, max, mean, median, and standard deviation duration per validator.
--
-- The ':epoch' variable is set by the calling shell script.

-- Disable paging for this session to ensure clean output
\pset pager off

-- Delete existing stats for the given epoch to ensure idempotency.
\echo 'Deleting existing stats for epoch' :epoch 'from validator_stats_slot_duration...'
DELETE FROM validator_stats_slot_duration WHERE epoch = :epoch;

-- Calculate and insert new statistics into the validator_stats_slot_duration table.
-- All duration values are stored in nanoseconds, except slot_duration_stddev which is numeric.
